#
# This is main program file for automatic weather station project;
# codename SR0WX.
#
# (At the moment) SR0WX can read METAR [#]_ weather informations and
# is able to read them aloud in Polish. SR0WX is fully extensible, so
# it's easy to make it read any other data in any language (I hope).
#
# .. [#] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR
#
# =====
# About
# =====
#
# Every automatic station's callsign in Poland (SP) is prefixed by "SR".
# This software is intended to read aloud weather informations (mainly).
# That's why we (or I) called it SR0WX.
#
# Extensions (mentioned above) are called ``modules`` (or ``languages``).
# Main part of SR0WX is called ``core``.
#
# SR0WX consists quite a lot of independent files so I (SQ6JNX) suggest
# reading other manuals (mainly configuration- and internationalization
# manual) in the same time as reading this one. Really.
#
# ============
# Requirements
# ============
#
# SR0WX (core) requires the following packages:

import getopt
import os
import pygame
import sys
import logging, logging.handlers

# ``os``, ``sys`` and ``time`` doesn't need further explanation, these are
# syandard Python packages.
#
# ``pygame`` [#]_ is a library helpful for game development, this project
# uses it for reading (playing) sound samples. ``config`` is just a
# SR0WX configuration file and it is described separately.
#
# ..[#] www.pygame.org
#
# =========
# Let's go!
# =========
#
# For infrmational purposes script says hello and gives local time/date,
# so it will be possible to find out how long script was running.

# Logging configuration
def setup_logging(config):
    # create formatter and add it to the handlers
    formatter = logging.Formatter(config.log_line_format)

    # Creating logger with the lowest log level in config handlers
    min_log_level = min([h['log_level'] for h in config.log_handlers])
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(min_log_level)

    # create logging handlers according to its definitions
    for handler_definition in config.log_handlers:
        handler = handler_definition['class'](**handler_definition['config'])
        handler.setLevel(handler_definition['log_level'])
        handler.setFormatter(formatter)
        logger.addHandler(handler)
